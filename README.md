# Home Lab Setup

This is my personal homelab setup, awakening my home with various services and tools. I hope this setup can inspire you as you build your own homelab!

At the heart of it is an Dell Precision T3620, customized to handle everything from media streaming and file storage to home automation and security. Over the last 8 months, I’ve fine-tuned this setup for efficiency, using Proxmox as the main OS and TrueNAS for managing storage. The entire rack idles at around 90W, balancing performance and power consumption to keep everything running smoothly.
